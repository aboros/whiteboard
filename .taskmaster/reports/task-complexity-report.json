			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Project Setup and Dependencies",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Initialize Next.js project with create-next-app, 2) Install and verify all dependencies including Excalidraw and Supabase packages, 3) Configure Tailwind dark mode, project structure, and .env setup matching PRD.",
			"reasoning": "Straightforward automation via npx with standard Next.js setup, dependency installs follow best practices, minimal custom logic or integration challenges; primarily configuration and verification tasks with clear test strategy."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Supabase Database Schema and RLS",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: 1) Execute SQL migration for table schema, indexes, triggers, and RLS policies from PRD, 2) Enable Realtime and verify all policies, triggers, and access controls.",
			"reasoning": "Involves precise SQL execution with RLS policies and triggers which require careful validation; moderate complexity due to database-specific knowledge but follows Supabase standards with provided migration SQL."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Supabase Client Setup",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: 1) Create browser and server client files in lib/supabase, 2) Implement middleware client, 3) Integrate SupabaseProvider in root layout and test SSR handling.",
			"reasoning": "Requires understanding Next.js SSR patterns with @supabase/ssr package; involves multiple files and hydration concerns, moderate complexity per industry standards for auth client setup."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Authentication System",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: 1) AuthForm component with validation, 2) Login/signup pages with server actions, 3) Middleware for route protection, 4) Session management and logout, 5) E2E testing flows.",
			"reasoning": "Full auth flow with validation, middleware, SSR session cookies; high complexity due to security considerations, multiple components, and integration with Supabase auth best practices."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Board Management CRUD",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: 1) Server actions for CRUD operations with slugify utility, 2) Slug generation handling duplicates/unicode, 3) Dashboard page with BoardList and dialogs, 4) Navigation and 404 handling.",
			"reasoning": "Multiple server actions, custom slug logic, UI components with validation; moderate-high complexity from data flow, uniqueness handling, and Next.js app router patterns."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Excalidraw Canvas Integration",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: 1) Server-side data fetching in dynamic route, 2) Client-side ExcalidrawWrapper with dynamic import and initialState, 3) Responsive CSS and error handling for large datasets.",
			"reasoning": "Third-party library integration with SSR challenges, dynamic imports, hydration risks; complexity from viewport handling and performance for large JSONB payloads."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Auto-Save Functionality",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Debounced onChange handler with dirty state, 2) saveToDb server action integration, 3) Retry queue with exponential backoff, 4) Network reconnect and UI feedback.",
			"reasoning": "Advanced state management, debouncing, retry logic, error handling; high complexity due to async patterns, performance optimization, and reliability requirements beyond basic CRUD."

		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Real-time Collaboration",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: 1) Realtime channel setup and broadcast listeners, 2) onChange broadcasting with payload handling, 3) Conflict resolution (last-write-wins per element), 4) Reconnect logic with DB sync, 5) Multi-tab testing.",
			"reasoning": "Real-time sync with conflict handling, broadcast patterns, reconnection; very high complexity involving concurrency, Supabase Realtime specifics, and data consistency challenges."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Presence Indicators",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: 1) Extend channel with presence tracking and state sync, 2) PresenceAvatars component with multi-tab deduplication and UI display.",
			"reasoning": "Builds on existing realtime channel; moderate complexity from presence API usage and UI integration, but simpler than core sync logic."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Deployment Configuration",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: 1) Multi-stage Dockerfile and docker-compose setup, 2) Health check API route implementation, 3) README updates with deployment instructions and env vars.",
			"reasoning": "Standard Docker/Node practices with health checks; low-moderate complexity as it follows established patterns without custom logic or integrations."
