# Task ID: 10
# Title: Deployment Configuration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Vercel deployment, health checks, and production optimizations
# Details:
Implement health check endpoint at app/api/health/route.ts: GET returns {status:'ok', timestamp:new Date().toISOString()}; Create vercel.json with security headers and edge settings; Configure Next.js production optimizations in next.config.js; Set up Vercel Analytics for monitoring; Update README.md and create DEPLOYMENT.md with complete setup instructions, env vars, Supabase migration steps, and production best practices

# Test Strategy:
Deploy to Vercel preview environment; curl deployed-url/api/health; Test full flow in production environment; Verify health endpoint for monitoring; Run Lighthouse audit to confirm optimizations

# Subtasks:
## 1. Health check API route implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement GET /api/health endpoint in app/api/health/route.ts returning JSON {status:'ok', timestamp: new Date().toISOString()} for Vercel monitoring and uptime checks
### Details:
Create Next.js API route handler exporting async GET function; return Response.json({status:'ok', timestamp: new Date().toISOString()}, {status:200}); Ensure lightweight, no database calls for fast monitoring and uptime checks

## 2. Vercel configuration setup [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create vercel.json configuration file with security headers, edge settings, and Next.js optimizations
### Details:
Create vercel.json with: headers configuration for Content-Security-Policy, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, etc.; Configure edge settings for optimal performance; Set up redirects and rewrites if needed; Add build settings specific to Next.js application

## 3. Next.js production optimizations [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure next.config.js with production optimizations for image handling, output settings, and performance
### Details:
Update next.config.js with: optimized image configuration (formats, domains, sizes); output: 'standalone' for improved build artifacts; Configure appropriate cache settings; Enable appropriate compiler options; Add any necessary experimental features for performance; Configure appropriate runtime settings

## 4. Production monitoring setup [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2, 10.3
### Description: Configure Vercel Analytics and error tracking for production monitoring
### Details:
Enable Vercel Analytics in project settings; Add @vercel/analytics package and integrate into application; Configure error boundaries and reporting; Set up alerts for critical issues; Document monitoring dashboard access and interpretation

## 5. README updates for deployment instructions [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4
### Description: Update README.md with complete Vercel setup, env vars, build/run commands, Supabase migration steps, and production configuration
### Details:
Add sections: Prerequisites (Vercel account, Supabase CLI), Environment Variables (NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, ANON_KEY), Local Development (npm run dev), Production Deployment (Vercel GitHub integration or CLI deployment), Supabase Setup (supabase migration up, enable realtime); Include health check verification and common issues

## Authentication Setup

### Magic Link Authentication
1. Enable Magic Link authentication in Supabase Dashboard (Authentication → Providers → Email → Enable Magic Link)
2. Configure redirect URL for magic links: 
   - Development: http://localhost:3000/auth/callback
   - Production: https://your-domain.com/auth/callback
3. Add users manually via Supabase UI (Authentication → Users → Add user) - email only, no password required

### Important Notes
- Authentication is passwordless (magic link only)
- Users are managed manually via Supabase UI
- No password authentication or signup functionality is implemented

## 6. Create DEPLOYMENT.md with production best practices [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4, 10.5
### Description: Create a dedicated DEPLOYMENT.md file with comprehensive production deployment guidelines and best practices
### Details:
Create DEPLOYMENT.md with sections: Vercel deployment workflow, CI/CD setup, environment configuration, domain setup and SSL, monitoring and alerting, performance optimization tips, scaling considerations, rollback procedures, and maintenance guidelines; Include troubleshooting section for common deployment issues
